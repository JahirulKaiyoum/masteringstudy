                  Our unique learning model puts you first. Drive the bulk of your learning experience individually and with your peers
                  through engaging and meaningful activities.
                  We have developed a Learning Cycle that helps students learn new skills and master concepts. This 4-part Learning
                  Cycle incorporates the need to discover gaps in your knowledge and skillset, self-paced learning, peer learning (students
                  teaching and learning from each other) and facilitated group learning. Every stage of the Learning Cycle is incorporated
                  into the classes you take in your Leadership Core.
