            <p>Many institutions provide little to no practical work experience. They don’t start talking
            about life after education/graduation until a student’s final year. At Mastering
            Study, students begin their career development journey on day one. Students benefit
            from a three-month-long internship during each year of study.</p>

            you to build deep connections with potential employers and provides practice in solving real-world problems. You’ll have
            been exposed to the world of work, giving you an advantage over traditional education graduates in gaining employment
